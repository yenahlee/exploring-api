# exploring-api

Our team wants to focus on data analysis.

Our team is in the process of making a movie recommendation application. By using analytical algorithms, our platform will evaluate a user's cinematic tastes, taking into account various factors such as genre preferences, favored actors, personal ratings, specific thematic tags, and more. Based on this nuanced understanding, our system will provide a list of film suggestions ensuring each recommendation aligns with the user's unique cinematic preference.
